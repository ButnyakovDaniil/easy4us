easytoyou.eu are a brilliant service that allows unlimited ionCube decoding for a very reasonable monthly fee. it has no
way to upload a directory, so to decode a large webapp is a slow, manual process.

this script should take care of this process for you. the usage should be clear enough.

** there is a profound lack of error checking that will likely mean very large jobs might lose the session halfway though
and require a second run. by default it will skip files present in the destination dir **
